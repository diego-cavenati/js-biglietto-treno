 calculate ticket price
**************************/

// 1 - ask the user the number of kilometres he/she wants to travel
const userKm = Number(prompt("how many kilometres do you want to cover?"));

// 2 - ask the user age
const userAge = Number(prompt("How old are you?"));

// 3 - calculate the total price of the trip:
// ticket price is defined according to km (0.21 â‚¬ per km)
const priceKm = 0.21;

// ticket price without discounts
const ticketFullPrice = userKm * priceKm;

// 20% discount for minors
const discountMinors = (ticketFullPrice / 100) * 20;

// 40% discount for the over 65s
const discountOver = (ticketFullPrice / 100) * 40;

// The output of the final price must have a maximum of two decimal places, to indicate cents on the price
